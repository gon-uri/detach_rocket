Official repository for [Detach-ROCKET: Sequential feature selection for time series classification with random convolutional kernels](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10618-024-01062-7) and [Classification of raw MEG/EEG data with detach-rocket ensemble: an improved rocket algorithm for multivariate time series analysis](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2408.02760).

## Overview

This repository contains Python implementations of Sequential Feature Detachment (SFD) for feature selection and Detach-ROCKET for time-series classification. Developed entirely in Python using primarly NumPy, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn and Sktime libraries, the core functionalities are encapsulated within the following classes:

- `DetachRocket`: Detach-ROCKET model class. It is constructed by pruning an initial ROCKET, MiniRocket or MultiROCKET model using SFD and selecting the optimal size.
  
- `DetachMatrix`: Class for applying Sequential Feature Detachment to any dataset matrix structured as (n_instances, n_features).

- `DetachEnsemble`: Detach-ROCKET Ensemble model class. It creates an ensemble of Detach models. We recommend using this class for multivariate time series, especially if they are high-dimensional. After training, these models are also able to provide channel relevance estimation and label probability.

For a detailed explanation of the models and methods please refer to the [Detach-ROCKET article](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10618-024-01062-7) and the [Detach-ROCKET Ensemble article](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2408.02760).

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, execute:

```bash
pip install numpy scikit-learn pyts torch matplotlib sktime==0.30.0
pip install git+https://github.com/gon-uri/detach_rocket --quiet
```

## Usage - DetachRocket
The model usage is the same as in the scikit-learn library. 

```python
# Import Model
from detach_rocket.detach_classes import DetachRocket

# Instantiate Model
DetachRocketModel = DetachRocket('rocket', num_kernels=10000)

# Trian Model
DetachRocketModel.fit(X_train,y_train)

# Predict Test Set
y_pred = DetachRocketModel.predict(X_test)
```

For univariate time series, the shape of `X_train` should be (n_instances, n_timepoints).

For multivariate time series, the shape of `X_train` should be (n_instances, n_variables, n_timepoints).

## Usage - DetachRocket Ensemble
This model is more suitable for Multivariate Time Series with a large number of channels/dimensions.

```python
# Import Model
from detach_rocket.detach_classes import DetachEnsemble

# Instantiate Model
DetachRocketEnsemble = DetachEnsemble('pytorch_minirocket', num_kernels=10000)

# Trian Model
DetachRocketEnsemble.fit(X_train,y_train)

# Predict Test Set
y_pred = DetachRocketEnsemble.predict(X_test)
```

## Notebook Examples

Detailed usage examples can be found in the included Jupyter notebooks in the [examples folder](/examples).
