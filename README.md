Official repository of [Detach-ROCKET: Sequential feature selection for time series classification with random convolutional kernels.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14518)

## Overview

This repository contains Python implementations of Sequential Feature Detachment (SFD) for feature selection and DEtach-ROCKET for time-series classification. Developed primarily in Python and utilizing NumPy, scikit-learn, and sktime libraries, the core functionalities are encapsulated within the following classes:

- `DetachRocket`: Detach-ROCKET model class. It is constructed by pruning an initial ROCKET, MiniRocket or MultiROCKET model using SFD and selecting the optimal size.
  
- `SFD`: Class for applying Sequential Feature Detachment to any dataset matrix composed of instances x features (not only the one obtained by unsing ROCKET on time series).

For a detailed explanation of the model and methods please refer to the [article](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14518).

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, execute:

```bash
pip install numpy scikit-learn sktime pyts
pip install git+https://github.com/gon-uri/detach_rocket --quiet
```

## Usage


```python
# Instantiate model object
DetachRocketModel = DetachRocket('rocket', num_kernels=10000)

# Trian Model
DetachRocketModel.fit(X_train,y_train)

# Predict Test Set
y_pred = DetachRocketModel.predict(X_test)
```

## Notebook Examples

Detailed usage examples can be found in the included Jupyter notebooks in the [examples folder](/examples).
